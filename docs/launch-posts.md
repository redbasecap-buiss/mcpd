**Title:** I built an open-source MCP server SDK that runs directly on ESP32 — Claude/Cursor can now talk to your hardware

Hey r/esp32! 👋

I've been working on **mcpd** — an open-source library that turns your ESP32 into a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server. This means Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP client can discover and interact with your hardware directly.

**What it does:**
- Implements MCP spec 2025-03-26 with Streamable HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket transports
- Ships with 8 built-in tools: GPIO, PWM, Servo, I2C, DHT, NeoPixel, WiFi scan, System info
- mDNS auto-discovery (`_mcp._tcp`) — Claude finds your device automatically
- Python bridge for Claude Desktop (stdio ↔ HTTP)
- Auth, OTA updates, Prometheus metrics, captive portal setup

**Quick example:**
```cpp
#include <mcpd.h>
mcpd::Server mcp("my-sensor");

void setup() {
    WiFi.begin("SSID", "pass");
    mcp.addTool("read_temp", "Read temperature", schema, handler);
    mcp.begin();
}
void loop() { mcp.loop(); }
```

Then in Claude: "What's the temperature?" → Claude calls your tool → gets real sensor data.

35 native tests, runs on all ESP32 variants (S2, S3, C3). RP2040 HAL is ready too.

Would love feedback! What hardware would you want to expose to AI first?

**Title:** mcpd — MCP Server SDK that lets AI assistants (Claude, Cursor) control your Arduino-compatible boards

Hey r/arduino!

I built **mcpd**, an Arduino-compatible library that implements the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) on microcontrollers. It lets AI assistants like Claude Desktop discover and use your hardware as tools.

**Why this matters:** Instead of building custom APIs or MQTT bridges, you implement MCP — the same standard protocol that Claude, Cursor, and other AI tools already speak. Your ESP32 becomes just another tool the AI can use.

**Features:**
- Arduino IDE and PlatformIO compatible
- 8 built-in tools (GPIO, I2C, Servo, NeoPixel, DHT, PWM, WiFi, System)
- Streamable HTTP + SSE + WebSocket transports
- mDNS discovery, authentication, OTA updates
- Captive portal for WiFi setup (no hardcoded credentials)
- 35 unit + integration tests

Install via PlatformIO: `lib_deps = mcpd` or download ZIP for Arduino IDE.

Currently supports ESP32 family, RP2040 HAL is implemented and coming next.

**Title:** mcpd: Turn ESP32 sensors into AI-accessible MCP tools — works with Claude Desktop alongside Home Assistant

Hi r/homeassistant!

If you're running ESP32-based sensors and want to give AI assistants direct access to your hardware, check out **mcpd**.

It's an open-source library that implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) directly on the ESP32. This means Claude Desktop can read your sensors, toggle relays, or scan I2C buses — without going through HA or a cloud service.

**Use case:** You have a weather station ESP32 with DHT22 + BMP280. With mcpd, Claude can directly query: "What's the temperature and humidity in the greenhouse?" — and get real-time readings.

It's complementary to HA, not a replacement. Think of it as giving your AI assistant direct hardware access for prototyping, debugging, or specialized queries.

- mDNS auto-discovery
- Built-in tools for GPIO, I2C, DHT, and more
- Auth support (API key / Bearer token)
- Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint

## Reddit r/selfhosted

**Title:** mcpd — Self-hosted MCP server on ESP32, lets AI assistants interact with your hardware. No cloud required.

For the self-hosting crowd: **mcpd** runs an MCP server directly on your ESP32. No cloud, no subscriptions, no data leaving your network.

Claude Desktop connects to your ESP32 via a local Python bridge. mDNS handles discovery. Everything stays on your LAN.

Features: Streamable HTTP/SSE/WebSocket transports, API key auth, OTA updates, Prometheus metrics, captive portal setup.

35 tests. MIT licensed. Single dependency (ArduinoJson).

## Twitter/X Thread

**🧵 Thread:**

1/ Introducing **mcpd** — an open-source MCP Server SDK that runs directly on ESP32 and RP2040.

Your microcontroller becomes a tool that Claude, Cursor, or any MCP client can discover and use. No cloud. No custom API.

🔗 https://github.com/quantumnic/mcpd

2/ How it works:

```
Claude Desktop ↔ stdio ↔ mcpd-bridge (Python) ↔ HTTP ↔ ESP32 (mcpd)
```

mDNS auto-discovery. Streamable HTTP + SSE + WebSocket. The full MCP 2025-03-26 spec.

3/ Ships with 8 built-in tools:
⚡ GPIO read/write
🔧 PWM & Servo control
🌡️ DHT temperature/humidity
🔌 I2C scan/read/write
💡 NeoPixel control
📡 WiFi scanning
📊 System info

4/ But the real power is custom tools. 10 lines of code:

```cpp
mcp.addTool("read_temp", "Read temperature", schema, [](auto& p) {
    return String(analogRead(34) * 0.1);
});
```

Now Claude can ask: "What's the temperature?" and get real data.

5/ Also includes:
🔐 API key / Bearer token auth
📡 Captive portal (no hardcoded WiFi)
🔄 OTA firmware updates
📊 Prometheus /metrics
🧪 35 native tests (no hardware needed)

MIT licensed. One dependency. Works today.
